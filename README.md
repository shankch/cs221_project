## Repository Structure

2 different datasets : Movielens 100K & Netflix Synthetic Dataset. 

MGCNN is a Multi-Graph CNN able to operate on signals defined over multiple graphs. I have used this solution for solving the recommendation problem. However, the architecture is general and can be used for any multi-graph dimensional signal.

To run the program, simply download/clone the full repository and run the python files.
for example:

python3 movielens_process_rmse_supervised_approach_movielens_factorization_2_different_conv.py
